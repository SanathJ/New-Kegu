			'#3.) Do not spam. We want quality content over quantity.',
			'#4.) Negativity. We want to encourage communication, and excessive negativity doesn\'t do anything for anyone.',
			'#5.) Stereotyping and Labels. We look to learn and help grow with our community. This inhibits our mission.',
			'#6.) Channels. Contain things to the appropriate channels. Especially NSFW.',
			'#7.) Hot-button issues. This is a gaming server - Politics, religion and other hot-button issues are disallowed.',
			'#8.) Against Riot\'s TOS. Account selling/buying, boosting and anything else that breaks the Summonerâ€™s code.',
			'#9.) Against Discord\'s TOS. https://discord.com/guidelines',
			'#10.) Dealing with rule breakers. If anyone starts topics that you do not think are appropriate to a gaming server, do not engage with that person -- just report it to the mod',
